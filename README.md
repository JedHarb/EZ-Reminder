# EZ-Reminder
A mega simple app to remind you to do a thing today.

(This is half a hobby project and half annoyance at dealing with Outlook reminders.)

### Features
Super simple: run the app, put in a note and time, get an obvious pop up at your time with your note.
Can run multiple at once.

### Drawbacks
In order to keep this as simple as possible, I'm intentionally not adding extra features like snooze, recurrance, even dates.

### Misc
I've included the EZ-Reminder.exe to download, but AutoHotKey compiled scripts often get flagged by Windows as malware. If you'd like, you can instead save EZ-Reminder.AHK and install AutoHotKey to run it or compile it yourself: https://www.autohotkey.com
